# Charter for the *TemplateFlow* Organization

This Project is a sibling to the [*NiPreps* Community, and its governance model abides by the `PROJECT-CHARTER.md` document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nipreps/GOVERNANCE/main/org-docs/PROJECT-CHARTER.md).
Anyone with an interest in the Project can join the Community, contribute to the Project design, and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place, how to find consensus, and how deadlocks are resolved.
